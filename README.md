# SpringDefaultAOP
This project demonstrates **Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)** using `@Before`, `@Around`, `@within`, `@annotation`, and other pointcuts.   It shows how to apply cross-cutting concerns like logging and authorization to service methods.   The example `StudentAspect` class contains multiple AOP advices for different scenarios.
